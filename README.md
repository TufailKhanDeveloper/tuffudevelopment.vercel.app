## Deployment 📦

Now you'll only need to deploy the app to your favorite hosting provider.
Personally I'd recommend [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

1. Build the app

    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

2. Start the production server

    bun run start
    ```
